Notes on making a DTK release:


* first get and install the latest version of doxygen on your GNU/Linux
box.

* 2 Files that must be edited:

   configure.ac: change the release version
number, change the lib version numbers if it needs it, see notes in
configure.ac on that and the release date

   ChangeLog:  add release notes, say why your making a release, sign your
name, and date

* make sure that the script ./cvsclean is up to date, and doesn't remove
anything that it should not, or not remove anything that it should.

* Check files in CVS are what you think: Run `cd /TESTDIR && cvs -z3
co dtk2' (to make sure you have all the files you have are up to date,
or confirm that you have what you think you have) and `cd /WORKINGDIR
&& cvs commit' (to confirm that all the files that are in a release
are in CVS , and packages that DTK depends on) and in a different
directory `cvs co' to confirm your files are "really" in CVS.

So CVS must be up to date with releases, or we are branching, or other???

* test, test, and test a build and install

* On GNU/Linux run `./cvsclean && make && make dist' to make tarballs

* check that the tarball dtk-$(VERSION).tar.bz2 (or dtk-$(VERSION).tar.gz)
has got all the files that are in CVS and some more (like configure, and
Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, */*/Makefile.in, and etc.).  If needed, check
that the new tarball builds and installs.

* if the tarball fails to have all the needed files start over ... else go
to the next step

* (optional) Update the homepage if that makes sense, run `make homepage'
and untar the files in
username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/d/di/diversetoolkit/htdocs/
using the cammand:

(cd /home/groups/d/di/diversetoolkit/htdocs/ && \
umask 0002 && tar -xvjf dtk_homepage-2.4.12.tar.bz2)

    - `make homepage' needs DTK to be built so that it can make the
       documents

    - You may need to get some file permissions changed.


A homepage update is needed. The web docs that are on sourceforge are a
little moldy.

* upload dtk-$(VERSION).tar.bz2 and dtk-$(VERSION).tar.gz to sourceforge
ftp server like so:

ftp upload.sourceforge.net
anonymous
USERNAME@users.sourceforge.net
cd /incoming
put dtk-$(VERSION).tar.gz.md5
put dtk-$(VERSION).tar.bz2.md5
put dtk-$(VERSION).tar.bz2
put dtk-$(VERSION).tar.gz

* goto
https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=70210
to add the release.  Look at the other releases to see the name
convention and etc.  You'll see lots of instruction at that URL.
