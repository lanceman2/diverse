<h2>The DIVERSE Toolkit Directives</h2>
</center>

<br>

Here's a ordered list of objectives that are part of the DIVERSE
Toolkit (DTK) software design philosophy, as written and maintained by
Lance Arsenault and with contrubutions to the original version from
John Kelso.&nbsp; A modified version of this has been adopted by <a
href="http://diverse.sourceforge.net/">DIVERSE</a>.

<p>
Some people ask: "Why'd ya make it that way."&nbsp; The answer can
usually be derived from the DIVERSE Toolkit Directives:

<ol>

<li>
<b>Works by Default (The prime directive)</b>

<blockquote>

Reasonable default behaviors are needed by any good software.  We try
to make the default to be the case that is most used or the least
damaging, if the most used case can cause harm.  "Works by Default"
also implies that the software should be robust or work all the time.

</blockquote>

</li>


<li>
<b>Stay Out of the Users Way</b>

<blockquote>

For API's this means stay out of the application programmers
way.&nbsp; We have noticed that some softwares can get in your way and
keep you from doing interesting things.&nbsp; They are designed to be
a central part of whatever you're doing.&nbsp; We say that they have
that "center of the universe" design paradigm.&nbsp;

<p> We assume that the user knows better how to design and structure
what the user is doing.&nbsp; This software is designed to augment
without imposing a particular structure.&nbsp; This gives users
freedom in design.

</blockquote>
</li>


<li>
<b>Easy to Use</b>

<blockquote>

At the surface this one's a no-brainer.  It's also a generalization of
1.&nbsp; Sometimes 3 conflicts with 2, but since 2 fosters innovation
and flexibility we lean a little more towards 2.

</blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<b>Short Termers Don't Count</b>

<blockquote>

Sometimes there are design decisions to be made.&nbsp; Any design
decisions that affect interfaces will be made with the interest of the
project for the long haul.&nbsp; Put another way: interface design
decisions must be made with foresight.

<p>

This may seem obvious, but this is helpful in providing reasons for
telling half-wit know-it-alls, and sloppy-coders, "NO!, We're doing
it this way."
