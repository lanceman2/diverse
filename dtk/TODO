Add a configure test for glut.h and -lglut after the fltk testing so that
the building and installing of dtk-gnomonDisplay can be skipped,
with a glutinclude and glutlibdir options too.

If a process terminates while waiting on a dtkConditional, on IRIX,
the shared memory will be rendered unusable.  This needs fixing.

Fix dtk-timeControl to show consistant time in all widgeted all the
time, currently when it pauses the two text widgets can be off by 0.1
seconds.

write and add DSO plug-in xSimpleDisplay

fix FLTK <ecsape> exit bug

add MULTI_THREADED option to server in UNIX platforms .  The code is
there it just needs the configure options.

add optional configServices to service build and install

organize the service, filter, and augment DSO plugins

add configure option to remove the program dtk-gnomonDisplay
do to add GL and GLUT dependence

Add view/display class that is like Open Producer, but better :).
