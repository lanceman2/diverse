John Kelso has updated parts of the API for usage on the NIST RAVE (2006),
and added functionality to the DOSG components.

Patrick Shinpaugh has helped with releases and maintenance (2005-2006).

Thank you goes to Patrick Shinpaugh for ideas for the code (and DIVERSE 3
contributions), and to Daniel Larimer and Mike Shore for contributing to
DIVERSE 3 which helped DGL become what it is.
