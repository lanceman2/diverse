This service reads from RS232 serial to an IRIX machine, to get the
old (1995 or so) CAVE (TM) Wand Joystick data (2 floats) and 3 (up to
8) buttons.

This "standard" was developed by the University of Illinois Electronic
Visualization Lab in Chicago.  A PC was used to read using some kind
of cheap ISA AtoD board and then write the data via RS232, hence the
name "PCWand".  It's from the first and original ImmersaDesk (TM).

It reads the RS232 serial line and then writes to DTK shared memory
named "joysick" (2 floats) and "wand" (unsigned char).

Also it can write the Wand joystick and button data to system V shared
memory using the old VRCO Trackd format.
