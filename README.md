# (a fork of) DIVERSE
Device Independent Virtual Environments - Reconfigurable, Scalable, Extensible

This is a fork of DIVERSE from https://svn.code.sf.net/p/diverse/code/trunk

At the time of this git repository creation [Mon, 14 Dec 2015]
the late code change to https://svn.code.sf.net/p/diverse/code/trunk was
on Thu, 09 Aug 2012.

The last svn log entry (at the time of this writing) was:

<pre>
r995 | pshinpaugh | 2012-08-09 17:26:59 -0400 (Thu, 09 Aug 2012) | 2 lines

Fixed bug when quitting using escape key
</pre>


## Why?

We do not have write access to the code at
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/diverse/code/trunk and we need to use and
maintain this code.


## Old Documentation on the Web

The old DIVERSE web pages are at URL
