	  source.  Much easier and standard build and install.

	  or 2.3.2 releases for IRIX and MS Windows.
	* changed from -> to the name of some DTK public MACROS like:
	  Linux -> DTK_ARCH_Linux   is defined on GNU/Linux systems
	  IRIX  -> DTK_ARCH_IRIX    is defined on IRIX systems
	  DEFAULT_DTK_SERVER_ADDRESS -> DTK_DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS
	  -- is more name-space like
	  and a few others, most of which will not effect DTK API
	  user code, but might for those who dig deep
	* Added library interface numbering using GNU LibTool so
	  the libraries numbers are like libdtk.so.0.0.0  They should
	  be interface compatible with libdtk.so.2.3.2 from release dtk-2.3.2.
	* plan on release 2.4.? to be ported to IRIX and then Windoz
