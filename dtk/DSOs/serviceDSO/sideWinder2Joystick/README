This DTK service reads the Micro$oft (TM), Side Winder Precision 2
Joystick using USB, on GNU/Linux systems.  I used RedHat Linux version
7.3 .  This may work with other USB Joysticks.


First run `dtk-usbProbe -h' then
run `dtk-usbProbe' with your USB device plugged in to test it.



This service writes to DTK shared memory files and following data:


shared mem file     data              description
-----------------  -----------       -----------------

sideWinder2/joystick   3 floats          X, Y, Z
                                      X,Y,Z ranges -1 to 1

sideWinder2/throttle   1 float           throttle
                                      throttle ranges 0 to 1

sideWinder2/hat        2 chars           x and y directions
                                      x and y range -1,0,1

                                      hat buttons are mapped to the 9
				      corners, mid-points and center
                                      of a square going from -1 to 1 
                                      on a side- i.e, 0,0 is the center
                                      resting position, 0,1 is up,
                                      1,0 is right, -1,0 is left, 0,-1
                                      is down, 1,1 is up and right, etc.

sideWinder2/buttons    1 unsigned char   9 bits used, bits 0 to 6
                                      bits in order
                                      trigger, then 8 other buttons



To get a clue run `./demo.sh' from this service sideWinder2Joystick/
directory.
