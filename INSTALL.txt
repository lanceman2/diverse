Installation instructions for all platforms


Overview
DIVERSE (Device Independent Virtual Environments - Reconfigurable, Scalable,
Extensible) is a cross-platform API for use in building 3D virtual
environments for the desktop, stereo walls, CAVE (TM), RAVE (TM), etc.


Dependencies
FLTK (optional) - used for building various GUI utilities
OpenThreads (required by DGL) - an open source threading API
Producer (required by DGL) - an open source windowing API
OpenSceneGraph (optional) - an open source scenegraph API
Coin3D (optional) - an open source VRML API based on OpenInventor
VTK (optional) - an open source visualization API
CMake (required) - an open source Makefile generator

CMake
There is a command-line (cmake) and a GUI (ccmake) version of cmake. To build
in-source run cmake or ccmake from the top-level source directory. To build
out-of-source, create a separate directory and run cmake followed by the path
to the source tree.


General
in-source:

	cmake -i
	make
	sudo make install

out-of-source:

	mkdir diverse-build
	cd diverse-build
	cmake -i ../diverse
	make
	sudo make install


Environment Variables
If you have installed FLTK, OpenThreads, Producer, OpenSceneGraph, or Coin in
non-default locations you can set environment variables so that cmake can find
the files it needs more easily.

FLTK_DIR - the root FLTK installation directory.
OPENTHREADS_INC_DIR - the directory where the OpenThreads includes directory is
		located.
OPENTHREADS_LIB_DIR - the directory where the OpenThreads libraries are
		installed.
PRODUCER_INC_DIR - the directory where the Producer includes directory is located.
PRODUCER_LIB_DIR - the directory where the Producer libraries are installed.
OSG_INST_LOCATION - the root OpenSceneGraph installation directory.
COINDIR - the root Coin installation directory.


Linux/IRIX/Unix
DIVERSE should build without issue on Linux systems.

Mac OS X
DGL should be built and installed using X11. All DGL applications should be
run under X11. If you have X11 installed but cmake is unable to find X11
include or library files, verify that you also have the X11 API installed
(part of the XCode binaries and is not installed by default).


Windows
When linking to libraries .lib files are used which are usually installed in
lib directories. The .dll files are used at runtime and usually required to be
in your PATH environment variables. You can set environment variables through
the System control panel in the Advanced tab.

When setting environment variables it is important to remember that the list
separator is a semi-colon ';' due to path names using a drive letter followed
by a colon ':'. After installation in Windows some people may find it useful
to run the programs in Cygwin. If run from Cygwin (but not built in Cygwin),
then the separator is still a semi-colon ';' and any DIVERSE environment
variables should be set up using standard Windows path names.
