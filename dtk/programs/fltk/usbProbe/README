This DTK service reads the InterAct (TM), Axis Pad using USB,
on GNU/Linux systems.  I used RedHat Linux version 7.3 .  This may
work with other USB Joysticks like things.



You'll need Linux modules usb-uhci or usb-ohci, and hid, and joydev

The device file is /dev/input/event0 or /dev/input/eventX (where X is
a number).

run:

  lsmod

and the following (as user root) as needed to get the Linux modules
loaded and listed:

  modprobe evdev
  modprobe usb-uhci
  modprobe hid
  modprobe joydev

  lsmod


Then run Vojtech Pavlik's USB test program `./evtest'.  If it spews
when you move the joystick and hit buttons it likely worked.


Next you may want to run:

  chmod go+rw /dev/input/event0

to let none super users use the USB device.




It writes to DTK shared memory files and following data:

shared mem file     data             description
-----------------  -----------      -----------------

axisPad/joystick   4 floats          left_X, left_Y, right_X, right_Y
                                     ranges -1 to 1

axisPad/hat        2 chars           x and y directions
                                     x and y range -1,0,1

axisPad/buttons    2 unsigned char   11 bits used, bits 0 to 10



To get a clue run `./demo.sh' from this service axisPad/ directory.
