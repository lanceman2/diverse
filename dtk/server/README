If stderr (stdout) of `dtk-server --daemon' is redirected to
a file or piped, then the file stderr (stdout) will not be
closed.


If you run `dtk-server --daemon' as user root it will run the
DTK server part of `dtk-server' as user `nobody'.



If you run `dtk-server' as user root, it will automatically switch to
running as user nobody, the leftover root process is just there to do
"clean up" after the nobody process finishes.  All user requests are
handled by the nobody process.


A way to set `dtk-server' to run as nobody is:


run as root:


cd `dtk-config --root`/bin

chown root.root dtk-server
chmod o-w dtk-server
chmod a+x dtk-server
chmod u+s dtk-server
ls -l dtk-server
