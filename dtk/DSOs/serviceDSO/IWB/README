immersive work bench -- input devices

   o   Polhemus 3space Fastrak tracker

   o   custom 3 button mouse device thingy

This works on the Virginia Tech immersive work bench.
It's not much code, and could be modified.

To Use and Install

0. Choose your coordinate system parameters.  For example, the
   physical location of the tracker's origin, and unit distance.

   If you are using dgiPf, you should coordinate this with the dgiPf
   DSO for this device, so that the origin and unit distance of the
   display is the same as for the tracker.

   This file is coordintaed with the
	`dgiPf-config --source`/library/vtIwbDisplay.C
   The origin is 24 inches (see Note) behind the desk,
   72 inches from the floor, and centered on the display screen.
   One DIVERSE length unit is 36 inches.

   The display is 72 inches wide, 54 inches deep, and 36 inches above
   the floor.  It can be tilted off the horizontal by up to 18 degrees.

   Note: 1 inch == 2.54cm

1. Edit iwbFastrak.C

   Set the scaling and shift constants in the code as determined in step 0.

   Keep the editor running for following parts.

   edit: DEVICE_FILE
   edit: below the comments: /** EDIT * SCALING for wand **/
   and                       /** EDIT * SCALING for head **/

2. In this directory run:

   `gmake install'
   `dtk-server --daemon iwbFastrak'

3. In a separate window, run:
   `dtk-readFloats -r head'
   
   If you press Enter in this window it'll "capture" a output line by
   scrolling it up.

4. Iterate by moving the tracker to specific coordinates, editing the
   offsets and scale values, until the tracker data is correct for your
   purposes.

   Unload, make and load the service- for example, run:

     dtk-unloadService iwbFastrak; gmake install; dtk-loadService iwbFastrak

   Repeat the "capture/edit/unload/remake/reload" cycle until all data
   is of desired values.


Virginia Tech's IWB uses a serial mouse as its button device, which
works for this service.  The source code is iwbButtons.C

The dtk-iwb executable shell-script will start and stop the DTK
server.  It'll load the button and tracker services, iwbButtons and
iwbFastrak, respectively.
