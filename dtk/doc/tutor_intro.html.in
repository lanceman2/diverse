<h2>Introduction</h2>

 The DIVERSE Toolkit (DTK) is a toolkit for building
operator-in-the-loop real-time distributed simulations.&nbsp; It's
made for gluing together programs into simulations.

<p>The <b>DIVERSE Toolkit</b> (DTK) is made up of the:

<ul>

<li>
<b>DTK Server</b>,
which reads and writes to hardware devices (including network
hardware), and the 
</li>

<li>
<b>DTK Library</b>, a C++ API (Application Programming Interface)
that provides utilities and an interface to the server, and the</li>
</li>

<li>
<b>DTK programs</b>, that
provide utilities and an interface to the server.</li>
</li>

</ul>


<p> DTK introduces a new implementation of, outside of the kernel,
remote shared memory.&nbsp; Remote shared memory extends inter-process
shared memory to Internet shared memory.&nbsp; The code you write
using DTK looks as though your just using local shared memory, but by
using DTK shared memory a user can distribute this memory on IP
networks.&nbsp; The networking is all done on-the-fly while your
programs are running or not.

<p> The DTK server provides a "novel standard" for extending hardware
drivers (not in the OS kernel driver sense) to inter-process and
Internet hardware services with minimal coding.&nbsp; It does this by
providing all the overhead of a networked (or non-networked) server to
small device reading codes that are in the form of loadable dynamic
shared objects (DSOs) written in C++.&nbsp; The DTK server provides
networking, data queuing and polling automatically for any number of
loaded service DSOs.&nbsp; The DTK library provides a common API
interface to your hardware that is served by the DTK server.

<p> This tutorial serves to give someone with C++ programming
experience an idea of how to use DTK remote shared memory, the DTK
server, and other DTK utilities.&nbsp; We have strived to make the
examples simple sometimes at the expense of not being robust.
