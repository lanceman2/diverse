See <b><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~cwingrav/cwdiverse/">Chad
Wingrave's Additions to DIVERSE</a></b> for more DTK code for a fastrak
driver, a cyberglove driver and a pinchglove driver.  Additionally, Chad
is working on another layer on top of diverse and GUIs for controlling
drivers.

<p>

A particular version of a DTK release is the same as that version of a
prerelease.  Some prereleases do not become releases.  The contents of
the lastest version of a prerelease may change.  The contents of the
lastest version of a prerelease will not change after it is made into
a release.

<p>

We model the state of DTK software as evolving continuously in time.
Prereleases are just numbered (version) snapshots (copies) of this
state.  We often throw away many of these snapshots (prereleases) by
recycling the number (version) to label the next snapshot
(prerelease).  We keep doing this until we like what we see.  We keep
snapshots that we like as stable releases and don't recycle that
version number.  The stable release is then the same as the
prerelease, and a new number (version) is used for the next
prerelease.
