This DTK service reads the Micro$oft (TM), Side Winder Joystick using
USB, on GNU/Linux systems.  I used RedHat Linux version 7.3 .  This
may work with other USB Joysticks.


 

First run `dtk-usbProbe -h' then
run `dtk-usbProbe' with your USB device plugged in to test it.



This service writes to DTK shared memory files and following data:


shared mem file     data              description
-----------------  -----------       -----------------

sideWinder/joystick   3 floats          X, Y, Z
                                      X,Y,Z ranges -1 to 1

sideWinder/throttle   1 float           throttle
                                      throttle ranges 0 to 1

sideWinder/hat        2 chars           x and y directions
                                      x and y range -1,0,1

sideWinder/buttons    2 unsigned char   9 bits used, bits 0 to 6
                                      bits in order
                                      trigger, then 8 other buttons



To get a clue run `./demo.sh' from this service sideWinderJoystick/
directory.
